Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! On this site, you can learn about my education and work experience, as well as get in touch with me through a contact form.

This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js and PostgreSQL for the backend. The contact form stores user input data in a database, so I can keep track of messages and inquiries.

To run the website locally, you will need to install Node.js and PostgreSQL on your machine. Once those are set up, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install the required dependencies.
3. Create a PostgreSQL database and user, and update the .env file with your database credentials.
4. Run npm start to start the server.
5. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the website.
